                    <h3>What Did I Have To Do?</h3>
                </header>
                <p>For this project, I had to choose a passion, and then study it. I would learn more about it, and present
                    what I figured out to the class. I chose to do coding as my topic. The specific languages that I was
                    going to use were HTML and CSS.

                    <h3>My Goal</h3>
                </header>
                <p>I chose this passion because I did not know anything about coding yet. My goal was to learn about it. I wanted
                    to figure out how websites work and try to make one by myself. It not only seemed like it would be fun,
                    but I wanted to know what you could do with coding. A website sounded nice, because you could do a lot
                    with one. For example, there are websites for fun, news, information, learning, and more. Everything
                    on computers is written in code, so if I learned more about it, I could get a better understanding of
                    how computers work.

                    <h3>What I did</h3>
                </header>
                <p>For my Passion Project, I created many webpages, some showing the progress of my work, and some explaining
                    and showing how to do what I did. I put a clip of audio. I even added some links, paragraphs, images,
                    backgrounds, lists, headings, and navigation bar! I learned a lot of information while working on this
                    project. It was a bit new to me before, but now, I am a bit more familiar with it. I really enjoyed working
                    on this project, and I have learned a few cool coding tricks. I made this with the help of "Visual Studio
                    Code" editor, and Github.
