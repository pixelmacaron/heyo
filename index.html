                    <h3>What Did I Have To Do?</h3>
                </header>
                <p>For this project, I had to choose a passion, and then study it. I would learn more about it, and present
                    what I figure out to the class. I chose to do coding as my topic. The specific languages that I was going
                    to use were HTML and CSS.

                    <h3>My Goal</h3>
                </header>
                <p>I chose this passion because I do not know much about code yet. My goal was to learn about it. I wanted to
                    figure out how websites worked and try to make one by myself. It not only seemed like it would be fun,
                    but I wanted to know what you could do with code. A website sounded nice because you could do a lot with
                    one. For example, there are websites for fun, news, information, learning, and more. There are even more
                    things that I could do with code, such as making a game. Everything on computers is written in code,
                    so if I learned more about it, I could get a better understanding of how computers work.

                    <h3>What I did</h3>
                </header>
                <p>For my Passion Project, I created many webpages, some showing the progress of my work, and some explaining
                    and showing how to do what I did. I put a few videos, and some clips of audio. I even added some links,
                    paragraphs, images, backgrounds, and many more parts! I learned a lot of information while working on
                    this project. It was a bit new to me before, but now, I am a bit more familiar with it. I really enjoyed
                    working on this project, and I have learned a lot. I have learned a lot about what you can do with both
                    of the languages. <br>
