            <article>
                <p>I created this website for a school project, called the "Passion Project". In that project, the goal was
                    to select a passion, and then study it. It chose coding, with my specific languages being HTML and CSS.
                    HTML is for writing the basics of the webpage, and CSS helps add some design. I chose this as my passion,
                    because even though I didn't know much about code at first, the idea of learning how to make webpages
                    intrested me. We use them every single day, so if I learned about them, I would be able to understand
                    how people make their own webpages. While working on this project, I learned a lot. I now can understand
                    how some webpages are made. I also gained some knowledge on how to code. For example, I learned how to
                    make sidebars, I question that I have had for a bit of time. I also was taught how to add audio and video
                    to a website. Working on this project was not only intersting, but also fun. Now, I enjoy coding my own
                    webpages.
